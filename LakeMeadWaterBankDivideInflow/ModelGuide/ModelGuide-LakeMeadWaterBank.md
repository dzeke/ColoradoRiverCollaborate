# I**ntroduction**

The purpose of this tool is to give users the opportunity to immerse in water
user roles for a Lake Mead model based on the principle of divide reservoir
info. The process is: **A) Divide reservoir inflow**, **B) Subtract
evaporation**, and **C) Users withdraw and conserve within their available
water**, others choices, and real-time discussion of choices. We see uses of the
tool for two purposes:. We see use of the tool for two purposes:

-   As researchers we want to learn *Why* basin partners choose assumptions and
    *how* extreme; *Why* and *how* basin partners articulate their risk of
    uncertain future water supply and manage their vulnerability; and *Which*
    new insights they take from a model session.

-   Provoke thought and discussion to:

    -   Stabilize and recover reservoir storage under conditions of low storage
        *and* low inflow, and

    -   Give users more autonomy to manage their conflicting vulnerabilities to
        water shortages.

This document provides context information for each individual and group choice
within the immersive model. The document also explains how choices build on
existing Colorado River management (Appendix A). The document also suggests
potential values to enter for user choices.

## Types of Use

The model can be used in two modes:

1.  Synchronously by multiple participant where each participant manages one or
    more accounts (in Google Drive).

2.  By a single participant (manages all accounts).

Participants can explore:

-   Water conservation and consumptive use strategies.

-   Scenarios of Lake Mead inflow.

-   Joint (political) decisions such as:

    -   Split existing reservoir storage among accounts.

    -   Split future inflows among accounts.

# Step 1. Assign Accounts, Articulate Vulnerabilities, and Strategies to Manage Vulnerability

The Reclamation, California, Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico accounts represent
entities defined in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, US-Mexico Treaty of 1948,
subsequent Minutes 319 and 323, Lower Basin drought contingency plans, and
pledges to include more accounts (Table 1)(1922; IBWC, 2021; USBR, 2019; USBR,
2020). The Tribal Nations of the Lower Basin users represents Tribal Nations and
their settled water rights (Ten Tribes Partnership, 2018).

A participant can play one or more accounts.

The First Nations account allows First Nations of the Lower Basin to manage
their water independently from the Basin State in which the First Nation was
located. This set up differed from current operations where Basin States
administer water rights for the First Nations within their state boundaries.

Delete the entry in Cell A10 to remove the Tribal Nations of the Lower Basin

user. Removing will reallocate 0.95 maf of settled water rights – add 0.48 maf

to the Arizona and 0.48 maf to California.

## 1A. Explain cell types

Four model cell types are defined by fill color (Table 2).

**Table 2. Model Cell Types**

## 1B. Make Assumptions

### **(i) Evaporation rates**

Evaporation rates for Lake Mead are presently entered as the midpoint within
reported ranges of measurements (Table 3)(Schmidt et al., 2016). Evaporation
rates for Lake Mead are presently measured using state-of-the-art
eddy-covariance however there is a several year delay in reporting values
(Moreo, 2015). A sensitivity analysis found that the lower and upper bounds on
Lake Mead evaporation rates for a five year study for Lake Mead draw down saw
variations of 0.25 maf or less in Lake Mead storage volume.

**Table 3. Reservoir evaporation rates (feet per year)**

| **Reservoir** | **Midpoint** | **Range** |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Mead          | 6.0          | 5.5 – 6.4 |

![A graph of a line graph Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/b8c3487b2edaa090c29e635c0b64b2c1.png)

**Range of Lake Mead Evaporation vs Active Storage**

### (ii) Start storage

Reservoir start storage is taken from the [data
portal](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/mead-elv.html) (USBR,
2021b). Text in Column D lists the date. Figure 1 shows Lake Mead storage over
time (Solid black line).

![A graph of water and water conservation Description automatically generated
with medium confidence](media/6b1c8702d79a4c42d582bec134c4d9c1.png)

**Figure 1. Lake Mead Storage (solid black line), Water Conservation (ICS)
Account Balances (light blue fill), and anticipated lake volume absent the water
conservation program (dashed red line). The conservation program kept Lake Mead
level above elevation 1,020 feet (5.9 million acre-feet) during low lake levels
in 2022.**

### (iii) Protection elevation

The Reclamation user decides the Lake Mead elevation to protect against further
drawdown. An elevation of 1,020 feet was defined in the Lower Basin Drought
Contingency Plan (Figure 1, dark blue fill labeled Protect)(USBR, 2019). More
recently there has been discussion to lower the protect elevation to 1,000 feet
(Buschatzke et al., 2024). The Lake Mead Water Bank maintains the protection
elevation because the Reclamation user is always assigned a share of inflow that
exactly equals the account’s share of evaporation. The protection volume is
calculated from the Elevation-Area-Volume curve for Lake Mead. See worksheet
*Mead-Elevation-Area*.

### (iv) Storage above Protect Zone

This storage value is the Reservoir start storage (Cell C19) minus the
Protection volume (Cell C20)(Figure 1, light and medium blue fills labeled Water
Conservation Accounts and Public Pool). The Storage above the Protect Zone
represents the active storage that can be assigned to user accounts (see Row
35).

### (v) Water Conservation Program (ICS) Total Balance.

This entry is the sum of all existing water conservation program account
balances (Figure 1, light blue fill). These balances are also referred to as the
Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) account balances and are reported at (USBR,
2021a). Figure 2 shows Water Conservation Account balances over time for the
three Lower Basin states. Reclamation typically publishes values in Spring for
the prior calendar year. Note, Mexico’s water conservation account balance is
not shown in Figure 2.

![A graph of different colored bars Description automatically generated with
medium confidence](media/fb068f98d855c3c2aad9423fce82b26c.png)

**Figure 2. Lake Mead Water Conservation (ICS) Account balances over time**

### **(vi) Remaining Storage above the Protect and ICS Balances**

This storage is calculated as the Lake Mead storage above the protection zone
(Cell C21) minus the total water conservation program balances (Cell C21; Blue
Public pool in Figure 2). This storage represents additional storage that may be
allocated to the Lower Basin states or other users (see Step 3 Split storage in
Row 35).

# Step 2. Specify Lake Mead Inflow

Participants together choose the Lake Mead inflow for the year. This inflow
represents the sum of gaged flows for the gages most immediately upstream of
Lake Mead (Table 4).

**Table 4. Stream gages most immediately upstream of Lake Mead and used to
calculate Lake Mead inflow.**

| **Gage Name**                                              | **USGS Number** | **Years**       | **Link**                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| B. Virgin River at Littlefield                             | 9415000         | 1990 to Present | [Here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09415000/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D) |

Because Lake Mead inflow is uncertain—and likely differing from historical
inflows because of climate change—we can only specify inflow as a scenario
(Table 5)(Rosenberg, 2022).

**Table 5. Scenarios of Lake Mead Inflow (Rosenberg, 2022)**.

![A white sheet with black text Description automatically
generated](media/ac83cf6f7de3ca3fd5914400fb7c06cd.png)

For reference, historical Lake Mead inflows since 1990 varied from 8 to 16
million acre-feet per year (Figure 3) with the preponderance of inflows between
9 and 10 maf per year (corresponding to a Lake Powell release between 8.23 and 9
maf per year; Figure 4).

**Figure 4. Histogram of Lake Mead inflows as measured by the nearest gages.**

Additionally note that Colorado River flow near Peachtree is the annual Lake
Powell release plus 600,000 to 1 million acre-feet of gains along Grand Canyon
(Rosenberg, 2022; Wang and Schmidt, 2020; Figure 5).

**Figure 5. Mean Grand Canyon tributary flow (Glen Canyon Dam to Lake Mead) for
different sequence lengths.**

Further note that different methods to estimate Lake Mead inflow give different
values (Figure 6). For example:

-   Nearest USGS gages.

-   Inflow data downloaded from the Reclamation Application Programming
    Interface (API; https:

-   //www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/riverops/_HdbWebQuery.html).

-   Back calculate from Lake Mead storage, release, Nevada Diversion, and Lake
    Mead evaporation data also retrieved from the Reclamation API.

-   Back calculate from Lake Mead storage, release, Nevada Diversion, and Lake
    Mead evaporation (1990 to present). Here we use evaporation data from
    elevation-storage-area relationship from Colorado River Simulation System
    (CRSS) model.

**Figure 6. Differing values for Lake Mead inflow as estimated by different
methods.**

This work uses gages closest to Lake Mead because these values gave the
*largest* annual inflows.

## 2A. Begin of year reservoir storage

In Year 1 (Column C), beginning of year reservoir storage is the Lake Mead
volumes specified in Cell B19.

In subsequent years (Columns D, E, …), the Lake Mead storage volume is the is
the storage at the end of the prior year (Row 134).

# Step 3. Split existing Lake Mead storage among accounts (year 1 only)

Participants split the starting Lake Mead active storage specified in Row 19
among the users. This split is a joint choice (Orange Cells B36 to B41). There
are many possibilities.

However, suggestions for the split can be informed by the prior choice for the
Reclamation Protect Elevation (Cell B20) and existing Water Conservation (ICS)
Account Balances (Figures 1 and 2; Table 6). When using existing Water
Conservation Account balances, users can access **all** of the prior conserved
water (rollover) and current account balance at **any time** because the
protection volume ensures a minimum storage volume and account balances must
always stay zero or positive. In this setup, *there is no trigger to prohibit
debits.*

**Table 6. Suggested split of existing Lake Mead storage**

| **User**    | **Suggested initial volume**                                                                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reclamation | Protection volume entered in Row 20. This level is shown as elevation 1,020 feet in Figure 1.            |
| California  | Water Conservation (ICS) account balance shown in Figure 2 (rollover).                                   |
| Arizona     | Water Conservation (ICS) account balance shown in Figure 2 (rollover).                                   |
| Nevada      | Water Conservation (ICS) account balance shown in Figure 2 (rollover).                                   |
| Mexico      | Water Conservation account balance under Minutes 323 to the U.S.-Mexico Treaty (IBWC, 2021; USBR, 2019). |
| Other users | Remaining water in the Public Pool shown in Figure 1.                                                    |

If the Lake Mead active storage minus the Water Conservation Account balances:

-   Fall below the Reclamation protect elevation (such as in 2022 in Figure 1),
    the states will need to negotiate the split. In this case, states will
    receive less than their water conservation account balance.

-   Are above the Reclamation protect elevation (such as in 2008 to 2021 and
    2023), the additional water (Public pool in Figure 1) can be assigned to
    other users such as Tribal Nations of the Lower Basin.

In actuality, the participants will negotiate over a share of the existing
reservoir storage. In these negotiations, participants will get the same or more
storage water as they get with current operations.

## 3B. Calculate Mead Evaporation

Reservoir evaporation volume is the product of (i) annual evaporation rate (see
Row 18), and the lake surface area associated with the current reservoir volume.
Find the Elevation-Storage-Area relationship on the *Mead-Elevation-Area*
worksheets (far right). Data were download from the Colorado River Simulation
System (CRSS) model (Wheeler et al., 2019; Zagona et al., 2001).

The total reservoir evaporation is divided among water users in proportion to
their account balance (Equation 1, evaporation terms in maf per year, balance
and storage terms in maf).

![](media/b0f6fb8c83d308f61784c4ce08a64809.png)

For example, if Lake Mead active storage is 7.2 maf and Lake Mead evaporation is
0.4 maf for the year, and:

-   California has an account balance of 0.72 maf (10% of the active storage),
    then California is assigned 10% of the total evaporation or 0.04 maf that
    year.

-   The Reclamation protect elevation is 1,000 feet (4.5 maf; 62.5%), the
    Reclamation is assigned 62.5% of the total evaporation or 0.25 maf that
    year.

# Split Lake Mead inflow among accounts

Participants split the Lake Mead inflow among accounts (See Row 28). There are
lots of ways to split inflow among the users.

To maintain the Reclamation protection elevation, this user is assigned *the
first block of inflow to* exactly offset to it’s share of the annual reservoir
evaporation (Row 46). This volume will vary from year to year as Lake Mead
storage and evaporation vary.

Splits of reservoir inflow among the other users can leverage prior shortage
sharing agreements, including the recent Lower Basin Alternative (Buschatzke et
al., 2024). This proposal allocated user reductions as a percentage of the total
mandatory reduction (Table 7). Thus A user’s share of the reservoir inflow is
their historical allocation minus the agreed-on shortage volume (Table 8).
Several examples follow to illustrate the conversion of share of *shortage* to
share of *inflow.*

**Table 7. Prior agreed Lower Basin shortages and shares of shortages
(Buschatzke et al., 2024).**

**Example calculations of share of Lake Mead inflow by volume and percentage
(Table 8) are:**

1.  Total Lake Mead inflow [B] = 9.0 ─ Total Shortage [A].

    1.  For example, a total shortage of 0.4 maf yields a Lake Mead inflow of
        9.0 ─ 0.4 = 8.6 maf per year.

2.  Share of Reservoir Inflow:

    -   Arizona [C] = 2.8 ─ Share of Shortage as Volume in Table A1.

        1.  For example, at 8.6 maf of reservoir inflow, Arizona’s share is 2.8
            ─ 0.28 = 2.52 maf.

    -   Nevada [D] = 0.3 ─ Share of Shortage as Volume in Table A1.

        1.  For example, at 8.0 maf of reservoir inflow, Nevada’s share is 0. 3
            ─ 0.03 = 0.27 maf.

    -   California [E] = 4.4 ─ Share of Shortage as Volume in Table A1.

        1.  For example, at 7.5 maf of reservoir inflow, California’s share is
            4.4 ─ 0.44 = 3.96 maf.

    -   Mexico [F] = 1.5 ─ Share of Shortage as Volume in Table A1.

        1.  For example, at 7.5 maf of reservoir inflow, Mexico’s share is 1.5 ─
            0.25 = 1.25 maf.

3.  Total Reservoir Inflow [G] = [C] + [D] + [E] + [F]

4.  A user’s Percent of Reservoir Inflow is their share by volume divided by the
    total volume.

    1.  Arizona [H] = [C] / [G]

    2.  Nevada [I] = [D] / [G]

    3.  And so forth.

5.  Total Percentage of Reservoir Inflow [L] = [H] + [I] + [J] + [K] = 100%.

**Observations**

1.  Nevada and Mexico’s percent shares of the reservoir inflow remain constant
    at 3.3% and 16.67%, respectively. These percentage shares are the same share
    of their historical allocations.

2.  Arizona’s percentage share of Lake Mead inflow decreases as the inflow
    decreases whereas California’s share of Lake Mead inflow increases.

# Step 5. Participant Dashboards – Conserve, Consume, and Trade

Each participant has a dashboard where they can trade, conserve, and consume
their available water (Figure 7).

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically

**Figure 7. Reclamation Protect Dashboard annotated. Starting storage is 1,061
feet (8.5 maf), the reservoir protect elevation is 1,005 feet (4.8 maf), and
there is 9.5 maf inflow this year. Thus, there is 4.8 maf of water available. No
trades or withdraws have been entered. So the ending balance is also 4.8 maf.**

### (i) Buy or sell water from other participants(s)

Enter buy amounts as positive (+) and sell amounts negative (-). These are
additions and subtractions to the account’s available water. Enter all amounts
in maf. If multiple transactions – e.g, buy 0.5 maf from Lower Basin and 0.2 maf
from Mexico -- enter as a formula: = 0.5 + 0.2

**These transactions are all temporary – for one year!**

When a buying account requires a selling account to invest financial proceeds in
new farm or urban water conservation efforts, the money stays in the local
community and the seller can make more water available in future years
(Rosenberg, 2021).

### (ii) Compensation

Enter compensation – payments for buying, receipts for sales – in \$ millions.
Enter as a formula. Multiply the sale price in \$/acre-foot by the buy or sell
volume in maf. Table 7 shows compensation and water prices for recentvoluntary,
compensated, and mandatory Colorado River Basin water conservation programs
(Allhands, 2021; UCRC, 2018; UCRC, 2024; USBR, 2021a; USBR, 2021c).

-   For example, a purchase of 0.5 maf at \$500 per acre-foot is (0.5)(500) =
    \$250 million.

-   If a participant buys 0.5 maf at \$500 per acre-foot from one participant
    and 0.2 maf at \$1,200 per acre-foot from a second participant, the
    compensation formula is:

Compensation = (0.5)(500) + (0.2)(1,200) = \$850 million.

The Lake Mead water conservation program has conserved more water than other
voluntary, compensated, or mandatory

**Table 7. Colorado River Basin water conservation programs and
accomplishments.**

### (iii) Net Trade Volume all Participants

Confirm the net trade volume for all participants is zero. A zero balance
indicates there is a buyer for every seller.

### (iv) Available Water

Available water is the water available to a participant to consume, conserve, or
sell to another account. Sales decrease and purchases increase available water
(Eq. 2).

| ![](media/5decdc4b51d5a9ff4d0ac1185446aabf.png) | (Eq. 2) |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------|

### (v) Enter Withdraw within Available Water

Account withdraws are consumptive use. This consumptive use occurs by a
participant physically withdrawing from the combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead
system at Hoover dam (Lower Basin, Mexico, or Delta). Consumptive use can also
occur by diverting instream flow before that flow enters the combined system
(Upper Basin). In the later case, the Upper Basin diverts the water and its
basin account is deducted the corresponding consumptive use.

Enter withdraws and consumptive use according to the strategy identified in Step
1 or modifications to that strategy based on current conditions.

Check that other participants do not withdraw more water than is available to
them!

### (vi) End of Year Balance

The account balance at the end of the year after deducting withdraws and
consumptive use. End of Year balance = Available Water – Withdraw.

# Step 6. Summary of Participant Actions

Shows participant actions grouped by Purchases and Sales, Account Withdraws, and
Account end-of-year balances. These groupings can help see whether sales
balanced purchases and also overall water consumption for the year.

## Lake Mead – End of Year

The Lake Mead storage at the end of the year after all account withdraws and
consumptive use. This volume is the sum of the end-of-year-balances in all user
accounts (including the Reclamation protect volume).

# Step 7. Move to next year

Move to next year. Move to Step 2 Specify Lake Mead inflow in the next year
(next column). Repeat Steps 2 to 7 for each year.

The purpose of this modeling activity is to provoke thought and discussion about
new Lake Mead operations. So continue to play years so long as the discussion
provokes new insights.

# Appendix 1. Summary of Current Colorado River Operations

The Colorado River basin has a long history. The parties do not get along. There
is much written material. This appendix summarizes key pieces and provides links
to the actual documents:

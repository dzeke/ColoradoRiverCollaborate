## Overview														
The purpose of this tool is to give users the opportunity to experiment with a Lake Mead Water Bank based on the Principles of Divide reservoir inflow, Subtract evaporation, and Users consume and conserve within their available water. The water bank jetsones the need for increasing mandatory Lower Basin water shortages tied to declining system storage. The water bank can help stabilize and recover Lake Mead storage for conditions of low reservoir storage and inflow. The water bank also increases water user autonomy to manage their conflicting vulnerabilities to water shortages more independently of other users while leverage prior negotiations and decrease conflicts post 2026.
To use, download the [Excel Model File](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCollaborate/raw/refs/heads/main/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx), 
move to Google Sheets, and invite participants. There are accounts for Reclamation (Protect Zone), California, Arizona, Nevada, Mexico, and Tribal Nations.
Over one or more years, participants consume, save, and trade water in the accounts. Read on for directions to use.

## Rquirements
**Facilitator**: 1 person to setup in Google Sheets (see Setup below), invite participants, and organize play.											

**Number of People**: 2 or more (facilitator may also participate).

**Time**: 1 to 3 hours.

**Software**: Facilitator has a Google Account.

## Facilitation Directions

**Setup**
1. Download the file **[LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCollaborate/raw/refs/heads/main/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to your Google Drive. Open as a Google Sheet.
1. Open the **Versions** Worksheet to see updates.
1. Duplicate the **Master** Worksheet to save a blank version for later use. 
1. Invite 1 or more other people to join the Google Sheet.
   1. In the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button.
   1. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet. Or copy and share the sheet's URL. 

**Use**
1. On the **Master** Worksheet, scroll down Column A. Participants enter values in rows with ðŸŸ¦ `Blue text`
   1. For example, in Rows 4-10, particants select a **User** and enter the **User's Vulnerability**, and **Strategy to manage vulnerability**. If fewer than 6 participants, participants select multiple parties.
   1. In ðŸŸ© `Cell B20`, the Reclamation user sets the elevation for the protection zone - Lake Mead will never fall below this level.
   1. Enter the Lake Mead Inflow for Year 1 in ðŸŸ© `Cell C28`. Cells below will populate.
   1. Participants continue to enter values in Year 1 (Column C) down to Row 137 in row blocks with ðŸŸ¦ `Blue text`.
   1. Move to Year 2 (Column D). Enter Lake Powell natural flow in ðŸŸ© `Cell D28`.
1. Find linked help for each row in ðŸŸ¨ `Column N`.
1. View the **Master-Plots** worksheet to compare entries to current operations (Law of River) [[This feature is not yet implemented]].
1. The **ReadMe-Directions** Worksheet also has these directions and describes all worksheets in the Workbook.

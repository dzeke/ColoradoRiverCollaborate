## Purpose														
The purpose of this immersive online collaborative model is to give collaborators the opportunity to immerse in and personify water user roles for a Lake Mead model based on the principle of division of reservoir inflow.  The model works on the principles of **A) Divide reservoir inflow**, **B. Subtract evaporation**, and **C) Users consume and conserve within their available water**, others choices, and real-time discussion of choices.
We see uses of the tool for two purposes:

1. As researchers we want to learn: Why basin partners choose assumptions and how extreme; *Why* and *how* basin partners manage their risk of uncertain future water supply; Which new insights they take from a model session. 
1. Provoke thought and discussion to: A) Stabilize and recover reservoir storage under conditions of extreme low storage and inflow, and B) Give users more autonomy to manage their conflicting vulnerabilities to water shortages.										

## Key Ideas
**1) Lake Mead water level is the sum of the protection elevation plus each user's available water.**

**2) Each user manages all their available water not just prior conserved water.**

**3) Tribal Nations of the Lower Basin manage their own settled water rights.**

To use, download the [Excel Model File](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCollaborate/raw/refs/heads/main/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx), 
move to Google Sheets, and invite participants. There are accounts for Reclamation (Protect Zone), California, Arizona, Nevada, Mexico, and Tribal Nations in the Lower Basin.
Over one or more years, participants consume, save, and trade water in the accounts. Read on for directions to use.

## Requirements
**Session Guide**: 1 person to setup in Google Sheets (see Setup below), invite participants, and organize play.											

**Number of People**: 2 or more (Session Guide may also participate).

**Time**: 1 to 3 hours.

**Software**: Session Guide has a Google Account.

## Directions to Guide a Model Session

**Setup**
1. Download the file **[LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCollaborate/raw/refs/heads/main/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow/LakeMeadWaterBankDivideInflow.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to your Google Drive. Open as a Google Sheet.
1. Open the **Versions** Worksheet to see updates.
1. Duplicate the **Master** Worksheet to work on in this session and save a blank version for later use. 
1. Invite 1 or more other people to join the Google Sheet.
   1. In the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button.
   1. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet. Or copy and share the sheet's URL. 

**Use**
1. On the **Master** Worksheet, scroll down Column A. Participants enter values in rows with 🟦 `Blue text`
   1. For example, in Rows 4-10, particants select a **User** and enter the **User's Vulnerability**, and **Strategy to manage vulnerability**. If fewer than 6 participants, participants select multiple parties.
   1. In 🟩 `Cell B19`, enter the Lake Mead starting storage. Find current elevation [here](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/mead-elv.html).
   1. In 🟩 `Cell B20`, the Reclamation user sets the elevation for the protection zone - Lake Mead will never fall below this level.
   1. In  🟩 `Cell B21`, enter the total Water Conservation Account (Intentionally Created Surplus) Balance. This value includes California, Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico.
   1. Enter the Lake Mead Inflow for Year 1 in 🟩 `Cell C28`. Cells below will populate.
   1. Participants continue to enter values in Year 1 (Column C) down to Row 137 in row blocks with 🟦 `Blue text`.
1. Move to Year 2 (Column D). Enter Lake Powell natural flow in 🟩 `Cell D28`.
1. Find linked help for each row in 🟨 `Column N`.
1. The **ReadMe-Directions** Worksheet also has these directions and describes all worksheets in the Workbook.

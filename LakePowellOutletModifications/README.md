# Modification to Lake Powell River Outlet Release Capacity

This folder explores the implications of Reclamation's March 26, 2024 Technical Decision Memorandum that establishes 
new Interim Operating Guidance for Glen Canyon Dam during Low Reservoir Levels at Lake Powell. The purpose of the Decision Paper is to establish prudent operating guidance to address the
potential for negative consequences associated with the long-term operation of the river outlet works at Glen Canyon Dam at low reservoir levels.

Reclamation established the new guidance due to concerns of potential damage to the river outlet works at Lake Powell levels
below the Minimum Power Pool (elevation 3,490 feet; 3.3 million acre-feet of active storage). 

The Excel file:
1. Reproduces Table 1 in the memo - Design Maximum Flow and Interim Maximum Flow for reservoir water surface elevations.
1. Converts the surface elevations into volume of active storage and the maximum flows into million acre-feet of release per year.

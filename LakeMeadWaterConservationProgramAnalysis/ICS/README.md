# Lake Mead Water Conservation Program (Intentionally Created Surplus; ICS) for Lake Mead

Plots water conservation account balances, deposits/withdraws, limits, and other data for the Lake Mead water conservation program. 
Within the Colorado River basin, the Lake Mead water conservation program is called Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) program for Lake Mead. This program is defined in the 2007 Interim Guidelines and 2019 Drought Contingency Plans (Reclamation, 2007; 2019). Also compares the ICS account balances to
withdraw limits and mandatory conservation targets .
